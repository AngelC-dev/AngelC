        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>As a blockchain and front-end developer, I have experience in both the development and implementation of blockchain technology as well as the design and creation of user interfaces for web and mobile applications.</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>In terms of blockchain development, I have a solid understanding of distributed ledger technology, cryptography, and smart contract programming on platforms such as Ethereum and EOS. I am familiar with various consensus algorithms, including proof-of-work and proof-of-stake, and have experience with blockchain development tools such as Solidity, Web3.js, and Truffle.


            On the front-end development side, I am knowledgeable in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as modern front-end frameworks such as React. I have experience in designing and developing user interfaces for web and mobile applications, including responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
           
            Overall, I strive to bring my knowledge and skills in both blockchain and front-end development to create innovative and user-friendly applications that can make a positive impact on society.</p>
