Hi Lead Developer Pascal van Gemert,

I am a front end development student and I was wondering if I could get access to the code for a website that you have built https://www.pascalvangemert.nl/. I am looking for code to study and use as a reference for my own development study projects.

I want to use this template to practice, please include the template readme document that explains how to get it up and running and make any necessary changes. It would be great if I could reachout to you as a mentor.

I am happy to provide any additional information you might need to consider my request.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards,
Angel Cruz
